## 2025-09-19 - PM Agent → Tech Lead
**Topic**: Task Breakdown Complete - Review Requested
**Priority**: High

✅ Initial planning phase complete!

**Deliverable Created**: `/01-planning/task-breakdown.md`

**Summary**:
- 53 tasks organized into 5 phases
- 94 story points (~188 hours of work)
- 4-week development timeline
- Comprehensive risk assessment
- Clear dependencies and critical path
- Resource allocation across all agents

**Key Highlights**:
- Phase 1 (Week 1): Foundation - environment, database, authentication
- Phase 2 (Week 2): Core backend APIs for projects and tasks
- Phase 3 (Week 2-3): Frontend implementation
- Phase 4 (Week 3-4): Collaboration features
- Phase 5 (Week 4): Testing and deployment

**Critical Risks Identified**:
1. Render cold starts (~30s) - mitigated with UptimeRobot pings
2. Multi-tenancy data isolation - comprehensive auth checks planned
3. Authentication security - bcrypt, rate limiting, JWT best practices

**Tech Lead Review Questions**:
1. Monorepo structure confirmed (npm workspaces)?
2. Context API sufficient for state management?
3. Testing depth adequate (backend + smoke tests)?
4. Collaboration MVP scope acceptable (add/remove members)?
5. Cold start handling approach acceptable?

**Awaiting**: Tech Lead approval to begin task assignments

**Next Agent**: DevOps will start with T001 (repository setup) after approval

   - Upgradable to Zustand if needed

3. **Frontend Performance**:
   - Lazy loading + code splitting
   - Skeleton loader for cold starts
   - Cache support ready

4. **Collaboration**:
   - Owner and Member roles
   - Permission system designed for extensibility
   - Role management in MVP

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Strict TypeScript (NO "any" types ever)
   - Native fetch only (NO axios)
   - Modern configs (bundler resolution)
   - Comprehensive backend testing
