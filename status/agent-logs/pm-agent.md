# PM Agent Activity Log

## Current Project Status
**Project**: Task Manager App (TMA-001)
**Phase**: Development Active - Week 1 Foundation
**Overall Progress**: 2% (T001/T053 complete)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13

## Session 1: Initial Planning

### Actions Taken
- [2025-09-19] Read project requirements from 00-requirements/requirements.md
- [2025-09-19] Created project structure (01-planning/, status/, status/agent-logs/)
- [2025-09-19] Initialized PM activity log
- [2025-09-19] Initialized team communication log
- [2025-09-19] Beginning task breakdown creation

### Requirements Analysis Summary
**Scope**: Multi-project task management app with collaboration
- Must Have (P0): Authentication, multiple projects, task CRUD, project sharing, basic filtering
- Should Have (P1): Task editing, priorities, due dates, search, member management
- Could Have (P2): Comments, subtasks, archiving, CSV export, dark mode

**Technical Constraints**:
- 100% free tier ($0/month budget)
- React + TypeScript frontend (Vercel hosting)
- Node.js + Express backend (Render hosting)
- PostgreSQL database (Supabase free tier - 500MB limit)
- No external paid services

**Key Challenges Identified**:
1. Cold starts on Render free tier (~30s after inactivity)
2. Database size limit (500MB)
3. Multi-tenancy data isolation
4. Authentication security on free tier

### Current Task
✅ COMPLETED: Task breakdown approved by Tech Lead
✅ COMPLETED: Tech Lead decisions documented
✅ COMPLETED: Task breakdown updated with architectural decisions

**Status**: Ready to assign tasks and begin development

  * State: Context API with modular hooks (upgradable to Zustand)
  * Testing: Backend comprehensive + frontend smoke tests
  * Collaboration: Add/remove + role management (extendable)
  * Cold start: Skeleton loader + lazy loading + caching
- MVP will be fully operational with scalable architecture
- Zero throwaway code philosophy
- Strict TypeScript - NEVER allow "any" types
- Native fetch only (no axios)
