# Backend Agent Activity Log

## Current Task: T005 - Design Database Schema
**Status**: Complete
**Branch**: backend/T005-database-schema
**Started**: 2025-10-14 22:35 UTC
**Completed**: 2025-10-14 23:10 UTC
**Actual**: 35 minutes (much faster than 3 SP estimate)

### Task Requirements (From Planning)
From task-breakdown.md line 62:
- Design database schema (users, projects, project_members, tasks)
- Schema supports multi-project and collaboration
- All foreign keys and indexes defined
- UUID primary keys throughout
- Proper timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Migration scripts are reversible

### Design Planning

**Database Schema Design**:
- Table: users (id UUID PK, email VARCHAR UNIQUE, password_hash VARCHAR, name VARCHAR, created_at, updated_at)
- Table: projects (id UUID PK, name VARCHAR, description TEXT, owner_id UUID FK → users.id, created_at, updated_at)
- Table: project_members (id UUID PK, project_id UUID FK → projects.id, user_id UUID FK → users.id, role ENUM, created_at, updated_at)
- Table: tasks (id UUID PK, project_id UUID FK → projects.id, title VARCHAR, description TEXT, status ENUM, priority ENUM, assigned_to UUID FK → users.id, created_by UUID FK → users.id, created_at, updated_at, completed_at)

**Relationships**:
- users.id → projects.owner_id (one-to-many - user can own multiple projects)
- users.id → project_members.user_id (one-to-many - user can be member of multiple projects)
- projects.id → project_members.project_id (one-to-many - project can have multiple members)
- projects.id → tasks.project_id (one-to-many - project can have multiple tasks)
- users.id → tasks.assigned_to (one-to-many - user can be assigned multiple tasks)
- users.id → tasks.created_by (one-to-many - user can create multiple tasks)

**Security Considerations**:
- Multi-tenancy: All queries must filter by user permissions
- Data isolation: Users only see projects they own or are members of
- No direct access to other users' data
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned data

**Indexes for Performance**:
- users: email (unique index for login)
- projects: owner_id (for user's owned projects)
- project_members: (project_id, user_id) composite unique, project_id, user_id
- tasks: project_id, assigned_to, status, created_at, created_by
