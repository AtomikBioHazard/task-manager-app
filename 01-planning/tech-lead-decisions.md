# Tech Lead Decisions - Task Manager App

## Status: APPROVED - Ready to Begin Development

## Architecture Decisions (MVP - Fully Functional & Scalable)

### 1. Monorepo Structure ✅
**Decision**: npm workspaces with `packages/` structure
- `packages/web` - Frontend application
- `packages/api` - Backend application  
- `packages/shared` - Shared types and utilities

**Rationale**: Clean separation, shared TypeScript types, scalable for future packages

### 2. State Management ✅
**Decision**: Context API with modular hooks
- Organized by domain (auth, projects, tasks)
- Designed to upgrade to Zustand if needed
- No throwaway code

**Rationale**: Sufficient for MVP, upgradable path, keeps bundle small

### 3. Testing Strategy ✅
**Decision**: Backend unit/integration + frontend smoke suite
- Backend: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Frontend: Critical path smoke tests
- Focus on quality over coverage metrics

**Rationale**: Ensures reliability where it matters most, efficient use of testing time

### 4. Collaboration Scope ✅
**Decision**: Add/remove members + role management
- Owner and Member roles
- Extendable design for future role types
- Permission system architecture ready for expansion

**Rationale**: More complete MVP, architecture supports future complexity

### 5. Cold Start Handling ✅
**Decision**: Skeleton loader + lazy loading + caching
- Skeleton UI while backend wakes
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Cache support for repeat visits
- UptimeRobot pings to minimize cold starts

**Rationale**: Professional UX, handles free tier gracefully

---

## Technical Standards Confirmed

### Mandatory:
- ✅ Native fetch (NO axios or unnecessary libraries)
- ✅ Strict TypeScript (NEVER "any" types)
- ✅ Modern configs (bundler resolution, ES2022)
- ✅ Monorepo in packages/ subdirectory
- ✅ All Docker files included
- ✅ Comprehensive README

### Code Quality:
- All types defined in `packages/shared/types`
- Backend exports types for frontend consumption
- Proper error boundaries in frontend
- Consistent naming conventions
- Git commits after every logical change

---

## Project Characteristics

**MVP Philosophy**: Fully operational, zero throwaway code
- Architecture supports scaling
- Clean patterns from day one
- Professional production quality
- Ready for real users

**Not a Prototype**: This is production-ready software with room to grow

## Updated Task Considerations

Based on decisions, these tasks need attention:

### T001 (DevOps - Repository Setup):
- Create `packages/web`, `packages/api`, `packages/shared` (not frontend/backend)
- Add shared package to workspace
- Configure TypeScript project references

### T024 (Frontend - State Management):
- Organize Context API by domain
- Create modular hooks pattern
- Document upgrade path to Zustand

### T021 (Frontend - Setup):
- Configure lazy loading
- Set up code splitting
- Prepare skeleton loader components

### T040 (Frontend - Collaboration):
- Implement role management UI
- Design permission system architecture
- Ensure extendable for future roles

---

## Budget Confirmation
**Total Monthly Cost**: $0 (All free tier)

---

## Approval Status
✅ **APPROVED TO PROCEED**

**Next Action**: PM Agent to update task breakdown with architectural decisions and assign T001 to DevOps Agent
